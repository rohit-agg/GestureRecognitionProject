## General Information

#### Objective
Develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote

## Approach

Following is the step-by-step approach followed to solve the given problem statement:
1. Generator
1. Model using Conv3D
1. Model using Conv2D and GRU/LSTM
